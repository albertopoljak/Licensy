        Arguments are stacked, meaning you can't pass 'license_duration' without the first 2 arguments.
        On the other hand you can pass only 'num'.

        generate
        generate 10

        generate 7 @role 1w

        License duration is either a number representing hours or a string consisting of words in format:
        each word has to contain [integer][format] , entries are separated by space.

        Formats are:
